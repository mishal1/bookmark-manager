#BOOKMARK MANAGER

Week 4 at Maker's Academy.

##Context
We built a bookmark manager, similar to pineapple.io or delicious.com in spirit. A bookmark manager is a good use case for exploring how relational databases work.

A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of links, organised by tags. You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse links other users have added.

The website has the following functionality:
- Show a list of links from the database
- Add new links
- Add tags to the links
- Filter links by a tag
